| On changing the goblin form, the current goblin item updates |        .5 |
| On submitting the goblin form, a new goblin is added to the view  |        .5 |
| On clicking a goblin the goblin gets deleted  |        .5 |
| On typing in the filter input, the goblins are filtered by name  |        1 |
| When you add or delete a goblin, the filter resets and all visible goblins are shown | .5

| Components                                                                                |             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| `App()` : tracks state for `allGoblins`,  `filteredGoblins`, `goblinFormName`, `goblinFormHP`, `goblinFormColor` |.5|
| `App()` : passes state as props correctly to `GoblinForm`, `Goblin`, and `GoblinList` |.5|
| `App()` : define a `submitGoblin` function that adds a new goblin to the array using form state. Note that this function gets passed down to the goblin form, which is where it will be attached to a submit listener |1|
| `App()` : define a `handleDeleteGoblin` function that deleted a goblin from the state array using id |1|
| `App()` : define a `handleFilterGoblins` function that takes in a string and set `filteredGoblins` to an array of goblins whose name matches that string |1|
| `App()` : add a `useEffect`: whenever the state of `allGoblins` changes for any reason, reset the visible goblins in state to show all goblins. (Clearing out the filter input box would be nice too, but it's optional) |.5|
| `GoblinForm({ setGoblinFormName, goblinFormName, setGoblinFormHP, goblinFormHP, setGoblinFormColor, goblinFormColor, submitGoblin })` : on change for each input, call the appropriate state handler prop with the correct `e.target.value` to update `App.js` state.  |.5|
| `GoblinForm({ setGoblinFormName, goblinFormName, setGoblinFormHP, goblinFormHP, setGoblinFormColor, goblinFormColor, submitGoblin })` : on submit, add a goblin to state by calling `props.submitGoblin` in the correct way.  |1|
| `GoblinList({ goblins, handleDeleteGoblin })` : takes in a `goblins` prop and renders a list of `Goblin` components. Note the prop drilling with `handleDeleteGoblin` |.5|
| `Goblin({ goblin, handleDeleteGoblin })` : takes in a goblin and renders it with the correct color background. Note the prop drilling with `handleDeleteGoblin` |.5|


### The bug!
- The problem: when I delete a goblin from a filtered list, it does not delete from the view. That's because we render filtered goblins, but we delete from all goblins.
- The solution: set it up so that whenever a goblin is deleted, we filter again.
- That means we need to filter our movies whenever the state of goblins changes. After all, if you delete a goblin, that only deletes it from the all goblins array, not - the filtered array, which can cause problems when you try to delete something while the filter is active. We can achieve this using a useEffect.
- So without useEffect, there is no good way to solve this bug. but you can still get full credit without solving the bug :) The bug is a stretch goal.
